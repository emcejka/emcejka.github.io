		<h1>Goodreads App: An Evolution</h1>
		<h4>A community platform lacking meaningful user interaction.</h4>
		<h4>2023</h4>
		<p>When I re-downloaded goodreads earlier this year as part of my “read more” new year’s resolution, I found myself wondering why so many of my friends recommended it. The interface was clunky and outdated. It was confusing to navigate the numerous tabs, buttons, and icons — many leading to the same place. The homepage felt like a worse version of the app's discover page, rather than a place to see what my friends were reading. Posting about a book was only possible if you were rating and reviewing it. It was hard to find a compelling reason to keep the app other than the list-keeping capabilities.</p>
		<p>Looking closer at it, I discovered a number of engaging features in addition to just tracking your progress on a book. You can actually make status updates, join interest-based discussion groups, andmessage friends. They weren't readily available, and despite these capabilities, I had yet to interact with another user since re-downloading the app. Finding features and engaging in the community turned out to be a buried and lonely experience.</p>
		<p>But what if the app was a robust, community-centric platform for avid readers worldwide? Why not expand on the app's market share for more engagement, allowing users to bond over their favorite works, discover new books from like-minded users, and meet people who share the same love of reading?</p>
		<h4> Problem Statement: The current Goodreads app fails to provide its users with an engaging and intuitive experience.</h4>
